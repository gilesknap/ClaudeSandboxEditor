# MD Collaborative Editor

A local markdown editor that renders exactly like GitHub, with Claude built in. You can highlight any passage and ask Claude to rewrite, tighten, restyle or critique it, then accept the suggestion or keep the original.

## Install

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/md-collab-editor)](https://pypi.org/project/md-collab-editor/)

Install it from PyPI as a command with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
uv tool install md-collab-editor
```

Or run it once without installing:

```bash
uvx --from md-collab-editor md-editor
```

`pipx install md-collab-editor` works too. Upgrade later with `uv tool upgrade md-collab-editor`. For the latest unreleased code, install from GitHub instead: `uv tool install git+https://github.com/garethnisbet/MDCollaborativeEditor`.

## Run

```bash
md-editor                       # edit the .md files in the current folder
md-editor ~/notes               # edit any folder
md-editor ~/proj/README.md      # edit one file (its folder becomes the root)
md-editor --port 9000 --no-browser
md-editor --agent claude        # side-panel terminal runs Claude Code without the sandbox
md-editor --ask-agent claude    # Ask Claude runs claude -p without the sandbox
```

The editor itself needs only Python 3.9+ (standard library, no dependencies). By default *Ask Claude* and the side-panel terminal both run Claude Code inside [claude-sandbox](https://pypi.org/project/claude-sandbox/), which needs [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), rootless podman (or docker) and `/dev/net/tun` on the host, and Linux or macOS. With `--ask-agent claude` or `--agent claude` they use the `claude` CLI on your PATH instead; uv can't install `claude`, because it isn't a Python package. Without any of these, everything except Claude still works. The page loads its libraries from a CDN, so the browser needs internet access.

The server listens on 127.0.0.1 only and checks the `Host` and `Origin` of every request, so other websites can't use it, even by DNS rebinding; forwarding the port to another local port (8765 to 8766, say) still works.

To work on the editor itself, clone the repo and run `uv run md-editor docs`, which uses the code in the checkout. Run the tests with `uv run pytest`; the browser tests also need `uv run playwright install chromium` (and Python 3.10 or later), and are skipped without it. The tests use stand-ins for claude-sandbox and Claude Code, so they need neither, and GitHub Actions runs them on Python 3.9 and 3.13 for every push and pull request.

## Working with Claude

1. **Highlight** text in the editor or in the rendered preview. In the preview a pop-up opens straight away; in the editor click the small *✦ Ask Claude* pill or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>J</kbd>.
2. **Choose** a preset (*My style*, *Improve*, *Tighten*, *Expand*, *Simplify*, *Fix grammar*, *More formal/casual*, *To bullets/prose*, *Critique*) or type your own instruction. An instruction ending in `?` is treated as a question: Claude replies with a comment and leaves the text alone.
3. A **card** appears on the *Suggestions* tab of the Claude panel, and the passage is highlighted in purple while Claude works and in amber when the suggestion is ready. Each card offers:
   - **Changes / Preview / Edit**: a word-level diff, the rendered result, or a text box for tweaking it by hand;
   - **Accept**: replace the passage (Ctrl+Z undoes it);
   - **Keep original**: discard the suggestion;
   - **Retry**: ask for a different version;
   - **Refine…**: give feedback such as "shorter" or "keep the first sentence" and get a revised version.
4. With nothing selected, the request applies to the whole document.

You can run several requests at once, and you can keep editing while Claude works, because each card tracks its passage as the text moves. *My style* uses the `nisbet-writing-style` skill; any skill in `~/.claude/skills` appears as a preset. The model menu in the top bar picks Opus, Sonnet or Haiku.

### Where requests run

Each request runs `claude -p` (headless Claude Code), with its tools limited to reading files and using skills, so it uses your Claude login and needs no API key.

- By default it runs inside claude-sandbox, as `uvx claude-sandbox@latest shell -c …` in the open folder (the requirements are the [terminal's](#claude-code-in-the-side-panel)). The request reaches the container through a short-lived file, `.md-editor-ask-….txt`, in the open folder, so the folder must be writable. Documents larger than about 100 kB can't be passed into the sandbox, so *Ask Claude* reports an error for them.
- `--ask-agent` (or the `MDEDIT_ASK_AGENT` environment variable) picks how requests run: `md-editor --ask-agent claude` runs `claude -p` natively, without the sandbox, and `--ask-agent none` turns *Ask Claude* off (the button is greyed out and says why).
- The document is sent to Claude once per version. When the *✦ Ask Claude* pill or the ask bar appears, a Claude session that holds the document starts in the background, and each card continues a copy of it, sending only the selection and the instruction (and, after small edits, a diff), so later cards are quicker and cheaper. *Retry* and *Refine* continue the card's own conversation. These sessions belong to the folder `/tmp/md-editor-ask` (in your temporary folder when run natively), so they stay out of your project's `/resume` list.

## Claude Code in the side panel

The ✦ panel has two tabs: **Suggestions** holds the *Ask Claude* cards, and **Terminal** runs a full interactive Claude Code session in the folder you have open. Ask it to work on your documents and its edits appear in the editor as it saves them. Drag the panel's left edge to widen it.

By default the terminal runs `uvx claude-sandbox@latest`, which runs Claude Code inside a [claude-sandbox](https://pypi.org/project/claude-sandbox/) container for the open folder. That needs [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), rootless podman (or docker) and `/dev/net/tun` on the host; the first start pulls the container image, so it takes a while.

- The session starts the first time the Terminal tab is shown. It survives page reloads (the scrollback is replayed) and ends when md-editor quits.
- **Restart** ends the session and starts a new one in the open folder. When a session ends by itself, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to start another.
- If you open a different folder, the session stays where it was and a notice offers to restart it in the new folder.
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> copies the terminal selection, and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> pastes. While the terminal has focus the editor's own shortcuts are off, so keys such as <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd> and <kbd>Esc</kbd> go to Claude Code.
- `--agent` (or the `MDEDIT_AGENT` environment variable) picks the command: `md-editor --agent claude` runs Claude Code natively, without the sandbox, and `--agent none` turns the terminal off.

The terminal needs Linux or macOS, because it runs on a pseudo-terminal. Only the editor's own page can connect to it, because the server checks the `Host` and `Origin` of every request.

## Working with Claude Code in a terminal

Documents are plain `.md` files on disk. When Claude Code, or anything else, edits a file, the open editor updates within about a second and briefly flashes the changed text. If you had unsaved edits at that moment, a banner asks which version to keep. The editor autosaves shortly after you stop typing (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> saves at once).

## Rendering

Rendering covers GitHub-flavoured markdown: tables, task lists (click the boxes in the preview to tick them), strikethrough, autolinks, `> [!NOTE]`-style alerts, syntax-highlighted code, `$…$` and `$$…$$` maths (KaTeX), ```` ```math ```` blocks, ```` ```mermaid ```` diagrams, heading anchors and inline HTML (sanitised). The preview uses `github-markdown-css` in light or dark (◐ button).

## Editing

The toolbar covers headings, bold, italic, strikethrough, quotes, code, links, images, lists, task lists, tables and rules. Shortcuts: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd>/<kbd>I</kbd>/<kbd>K</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> to search, <kbd>Tab</kbd> to indent, and <kbd>Enter</kbd> to continue lists. Scrolling in the editor and the preview stays in sync, and clicking a preview block moves the cursor to it. Misspelt words get a wavy red underline as you type (British English; code, URLs and HTML are skipped). Right-click one for suggestions, to add it to your dictionary (kept in the browser) or to ignore it, and click **abc✓** in the toolbar to turn checking off or on.

## Opening files elsewhere

Click **📂** in the top bar (or *Open…* in the file list, or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd>) to browse the disk. Click folders to move through them (↑ goes to the parent, ⌂ goes home), or type or paste a path and press Enter. Clicking a `.md` file opens it and makes its folder the working folder, so the sidebar lists its neighbours and live sync keeps working. *Use this folder* switches to the current folder without picking a file. The arrow keys and Enter also work in the list.

## Exporting to PDF

Click **⬇ PDF** in the top bar. The document is rendered in GitHub's light style (even in dark mode) on A4 pages, with maths and diagrams included and without Claude's highlights. It is saved as `<name>.pdf` beside the markdown file and downloaded by the browser. Relative image links resolve because the page is printed from the markdown file's folder. This uses headless Google Chrome or Chromium; set `MDEDIT_CHROME=/path/to/chrome` if it isn't found on the PATH. For the browser's own print dialog, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>; the print stylesheet prints only the rendered document.

## Files

All code lives in `src/md_collab_editor/`:

- `server.py`: HTTP server (file API, folder browsing and root switching, change events, `/api/ask` → `claude -p` (in claude-sandbox by default), `/api/pdf` → headless Chrome, `/api/term` → WebSocket onto the side-panel terminal's PTY)
- `static/index.html`, `static/app.css`: layout and GitHub-style theme
- `static/render.js`: markdown → HTML, with source offsets on every block so preview selections map back to the source
- `static/app.js`: editor, sync, selection mapping, ask bar, suggestion cards and word diff
- `static/term.js`: the side-panel terminal (xterm.js)
